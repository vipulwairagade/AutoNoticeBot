 Topic:
 Automatic Issue of Notices
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Problem Statement:

1) There are many cases wherein the traffic rule violators are not stopped on the scene and most of the times only the vehicle
number can be captured. Also images captured by the citizens of vehicles violating traffic rules are sent to the Traffic Cell via
Facebook or email. The police personnel also manually monitor the video stream captured by cameras situated at various locations.

2) Using the vehicle number captured, the police manually search the vehicle owner details on the internet.

3) After they obtain the address of the vehicle owner, they send the ‘Notice under Section 133 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988’ to the
police station nearest to the vehicle owner’s address.

4) The police personnel then takes the notice to the house of the vehicle owner in person, and the notice is served to the vehicle
owner. It may also happen that the person may not be available at that time, or may not be presently living at that address. The
notice thus remains not served.

5) This process has to be completed within 7 days of the traffic rule violation.

6) Once the notice is served, the owner/driver has to visit the Notice branch (Traffic headquarters) on a working day (within 30
days) where the traffic offence can the compounded by paying the mentioned compounding amount. Many of these traffic cases remain
pending due to:
    i. The correct details of the vehicle owner could not be searched on the
internet.
    ii. The vehicle owner could not be served the notice in the given time frame.

Desired Outcome:

1) A system that can automatically find the valid information, with respect to the owners of the defaulting vehicles
2) The information regarding the traffic violation to be sent to the owner through SMS or email.
3) Payment of the compounding amount to be done online.

(Sample Data Required: No)
